# Week 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the foundational week of our journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This week, we explore the fundamental concepts that bridge the gap between the purely digital realm of artificial intelligence and the complex, dynamic physical world.

## The Great Shift: From Digital to Physical

For decades, the story of Artificial Intelligence has been one of mastering the abstract. From defeating grandmasters at chess to generating human-like text and images, AI has demonstrated profound capabilities within the structured confines of a computer. These are **Digital AIs**—disembodied minds operating on data, symbols, and models.

However, for AI to truly assist humanity in a tangible way—to care for the elderly, automate dangerous jobs, or explore new frontiers—it must learn to exist in our world. It must get a body. This marks the most significant paradigm shift in the history of AI: the move from digital bits to physical atoms.

## Defining Embodied Intelligence

At the heart of this shift is the concept of **Embodied Intelligence**. We define it as:

> An intelligent agent housed in a physical system that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment using actuators.

This is more than just putting a brain in a box. Embodiment implies a deep, continuous feedback loop between sensing, thinking, and acting.

-   **Perception:** The agent uses sensors (like cameras, LiDAR, and microphones) to gather rich, often noisy, data from the physical world. This is its window into reality.
-   **Reasoning:** The agent's "brain" processes this sensory input, understands the context, and decides on a course of action. This is where AI algorithms for planning, learning, and decision-making come into play.
-   **Action:** The agent uses actuators (motors, grippers, and limbs) to execute its decision and affect the state of the physical world.

The consequences of these actions are then immediately perceived, creating a closed loop that allows the agent to learn, adapt, and behave intelligently in real-time.

## Why Embodiment Matters

An embodied agent learns differently than a digital one. It is "grounded" in the physics of the real world. Concepts like gravity, friction, and object permanence are not abstract variables but are experienced directly. This grounding is crucial for developing the common-sense reasoning that has long been a challenge for traditional AI.

In this course, you will learn how to build and program these embodied intelligent systems, starting with the fundamental building blocks and culminating in a sophisticated humanoid robot capable of autonomous tasks.
