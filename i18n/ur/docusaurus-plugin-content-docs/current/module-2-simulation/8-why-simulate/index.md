# Chapter 8: Why Simulate?

Before we dive into building our simulated world, it's worth asking: why do we bother? Why not just work with the physical robot from day one? This chapter explores the philosophy and practice of simulation in modern robotics, from the concept of a Digital Twin to the "Simulation-First" development workflow that powers today's leading robotics companies.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Define "Digital Twin" and explain its role in robotics.
*   Describe the benefits of a "Simulation-First" development process.
*   Identify Gazebo as a key open-source tool for robotics simulation.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 8.1: The Digital Twin Concept**
*   **Lesson 8.2: Simulation-First Development**
*   **Lesson 8.3: Meet Gazebo**
