# Module 2: Simulation

Welcome to Module 2. In the first module, you mastered the "nervous system" of your robot with ROS 2. Now, you will give that nervous system a body and a world to live in—a **Digital Twin**.

Simulation is the single most important accelerator in modern robotics. It allows you to develop, test, and iterate on your robot's software thousands of times faster and cheaper than you could with a physical robot. In this module, you will learn why simulation is a cornerstone of Physical AI, how to describe a robot's physical form, and how to build and interact with a simulated world using Gazebo.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Explain the concept of a Digital Twin and the "Simulation-First" development workflow.
*   Author a URDF file to describe the kinematics of a robot.
*   Build a world in Gazebo using the SDF format.
*   Add simulated sensors (cameras, LiDAR) to your robot and visualize their data in ROS 2.
*   Integrate a ROS 2 controller with a simulated robot in Gazebo.
*   Build and test a complete, closed-loop control system for a simulated mobile robot.
