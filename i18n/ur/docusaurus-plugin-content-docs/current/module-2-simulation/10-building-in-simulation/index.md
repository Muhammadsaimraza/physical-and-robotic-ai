# Chapter 10: Building in Simulation

You have a model of your robot. Now you need a world for it to live in. In Gazebo, a world is defined using the **Simulation Description Format (SDF)**.

SDF is an XML format, similar to URDF, but it is much more comprehensive. While URDF can only describe the kinematics and dynamics of a single robot, SDF can describe everything in a simulation: robots, lights, physics, sensors, and even the terrain itself.

In this chapter, you will learn the basics of the SDF format and how to create a world file to test your robot.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Create a basic SDF world file.
*   Add lights and a ground plane to a world.
*   Include models from Gazebo's online database (the Fuel marketplace).
*   Add your URDF robot model to the world.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 10.1: SDF World Basics**
*   **Lesson 10.2: Models from Fuel**
*   **Lesson 10.3: Physical Configuration (Gazebo-Specific URDF tags)**
*   **Lesson 10.4: World Building with AI**
