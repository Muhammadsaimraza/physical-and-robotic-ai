# Chapter 9: Robot Description Formats

How do you tell a simulator what your robot looks like? How do you describe its shape, its joints, and how they connect? You need a standard format. In the ROS ecosystem, the most common format for this is the **Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)**.

In this chapter, you will learn the syntax and structure of URDF. You will build your first robot model from scratch, starting with its visual appearance and then adding its physical properties for simulation.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Read and understand an existing URDF file.
*   Author a URDF file for a simple robot with multiple links and joints.
*   Add visual and collision geometry to a robot model.
*   Add inertial properties (mass and inertia) to a robot model.
*   Use an AI assistant to help generate and modify URDF files.

*   **Lesson 9.1: Understanding URDF**
*   **Lesson 9.2: Building Your First Robot**
*   **Lesson 9.3: Physical Properties**
