# Chapter 21: Module 4 Capstone

Welcome to the grand finale of this course. In this capstone project, you will integrate everything you have learned across all four modules to build an **Autonomous Humanoid** capable of understanding natural language commands and executing them in a simulated physical environment.

This project is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the entire Physical AI stack, from low-level ROS 2 communication to high-level LLM-based cognitive planning and motion execution.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Develop a comprehensive system specification for a voice-commanded robot.
*   Integrate Speech-to-Text, LLM cognitive planning, navigation, perception, and manipulation components.
*   Create a robust launch file to orchestrate a complex multi-node system.
*   Systematically test and validate the end-to-end functionality of an autonomous humanoid.

## Project Goal

You will build a system that enables a simulated humanoid robot to perform a "fetch" task based on a human voice command. The robot should be able to:
1.  Understand a voice command.
2.  Plan a sequence of actions (navigate, perceive, manipulate).
3.  Execute the actions in a simulated environment.
