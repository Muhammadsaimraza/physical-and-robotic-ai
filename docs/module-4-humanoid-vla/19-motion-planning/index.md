# Chapter 19: Motion Planning for Manipulation

Knowing *where* you want your robot's hand to go (the IK solution) is only the first step. **Motion Planning** is the process of figuring out *how* to get there. It is the problem of finding a valid, collision-free path for the robot's arm from its current configuration to a target configuration.

This chapter provides a high-level introduction to the concepts of motion planning and to **MoveIt**, the standard motion planning framework in the ROS ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Define motion planning and explain why it is a hard problem.
*   Describe the role of collision checking in motion planning.
*   Identify MoveIt2 as the primary tool for manipulation in ROS 2.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 19.1: What is Motion Planning?**
*   **Lesson 19.2: Introduction to MoveIt2**
