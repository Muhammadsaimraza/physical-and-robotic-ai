# Chapter 18: Humanoid Kinematics & Dynamics

A humanoid robot has a complex, multi-jointed body. To make it move, we must first understand the mathematics that governs its geometry and motion. This chapter introduces the two core disciplines for this: **kinematics** and **dynamics**.

*   **Kinematics** is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. It's the geometry of the robot's skeleton.
*   **Dynamics** is the study of motion in relation to the forces and torques that cause it. It's the physics of how the robot balances and moves.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Differentiate between forward and inverse kinematics.
*   Explain the role of an IK solver in motion planning.
*   Define Center of Mass (CoM) and Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and explain their importance for bipedal locomotion.
