# Chapter 4: Your First ROS 2 Code

You've explored ROS 2 from the command line. Now it's time to write your own nodes. In this chapter, you will transition from being a ROS *user* to a ROS *developer*. You will learn how to structure your code into workspaces and packages, and you will write your first Python publisher and subscriber nodes.

This is where the course transitions from conceptual to practical. You will be writing, compiling, and running your own code. We will also introduce the "AI Collaboration" layer of our teaching method, providing you with prompts to use generative AI as your programming partner.

*   **Duration:** 4 lessons, 4 hours total
*   **Layer Breakdown:** L2: AI Collaboration (You write code with AI assistance)
*   **Hardware Tier:** Tier 1 (Cloud ROS 2 environment or local install)
*   **Prerequisites:** Completion of Chapter 3, Basic Python knowledge

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Create a ROS 2 workspace and a Python package.
*   Write a Python class for a ROS 2 node using `rclpy`.
*   Implement a publisher node that sends messages on a topic.
*   Implement a subscriber node that receives and processes messages from a topic.
*   Use `colcon` to build your package.
*   Use generative AI to help write and explain your code.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 4.1: Workspaces & Packages** (60 minutes)
    *   Learn the standard directory structure for ROS 2 development and create your first package.

*   **Lesson 4.2: Writing a Publisher** (60 minutes)
    *   Write a Python node that continuously publishes a "Hello, World" message to a topic.

*   **Lesson 4.3: Writing a Subscriber** (60 minutes)
    *   Write a second Python node that subscribes to the topic and prints the messages it receives.

*   **Lesson 4.4: Try With AI** (60 minutes)
    *   Use provided prompts to have an AI assistant explain your code, suggest modifications, and help you debug.
