# Chapter 2: The Robot System

In Chapter 1, we explored the "why" of Physical AI. Now, we dive into the "how." A robot is a complex system of hardware and software working in concert. This chapter breaks down that system into its fundamental components. You'll learn how robots perceive the world (sensors), how they affect it (actuators), and the critical role of the software that connects them (middleware).

This chapter is still primarily conceptual, but it lays the groundwork for the hands-on coding you will do in the rest of the course. Understanding this system-level view is essential for debugging and designing robust robotic applications.

*   **Duration:** 4 lessons, 3 hours total
*   **Layer Breakdown:** L1: 100% (manual foundation)
*   **Hardware Tier:** Tier 1 (conceptual)
*   **Prerequisites:** Completion of Chapter 1

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Identify the three main categories of robot sensors and give an example of each.
*   Describe the function of an actuator and its relationship to a robot's joints.
*   Explain why middleware is necessary to manage the complexity of a modern robot.
*   Assess your own hardware and identify which "Hardware Tier" you belong to for this course.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 2.1: How Robots See (Sensors)** (45 minutes)
    *   Explore the sensors that give a robot its awareness of the world, from cameras and LiDAR to IMUs.

*   **Lesson 2.2: How Robots Move (Actuators)** (45 minutes)
    *   Learn about the motors and mechanisms that allow a robot to move and interact with its environment.

*   **Lesson 2.3: Why Middleware Exists** (45 minutes)
    *   Understand the software challenge of coordinating dozens of independent hardware and software components in real-time.

*   **Lesson 2.4: Your Hardware Tier** (45 minutes)
    *   A practical guide to the hardware requirements for this course, helping you identify your learning path.
