# Chapter 13: Module 2 Capstone

Welcome to the capstone project for Module 2. You have learned how to model a robot, build a world, add sensors, and create closed-loop controllers. Now you will put it all together to create a complete, simulated autonomous system.

Your task is to implement and test the "wall follower" skill you designed in the previous chapter, but this time with a full system specification and a formal validation process.

*   **Duration:** 3 lessons, 4.5 hours total
*   **Layer Breakdown:** L4: Spec-Driven Integration
*   **Hardware Tier:** Tier 2 (Requires a local Gazebo installation)
*   **Prerequisites:** Completion of Chapter 12

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Write a complete system specification for a simulated robotics task.
*   Create a launch file that starts Gazebo, spawns a robot, and starts a controller node.
*   Implement a closed-loop controller based on a specification.
*   Systematically test the integrated system against the specification.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 13.1: The Specification**
*   **Lesson 13.2: Building the Simulation**
*   **Lesson 13.3: Testing & Validation**
