# Chapter 17: Sim-to-Real

This chapter addresses the most critical challenge in modern, AI-driven robotics: transferring knowledge from the clean, predictable world of the simulator to the messy, unpredictable real world. This is the **Sim-to-Real** problem.

You will learn why models trained in simulation often fail in reality, and you will explore the state-of-the-art techniques that engineers use to bridge this "reality gap."

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Define the "sim-to-real" gap and identify its primary causes.
*   Explain how Domain Randomization helps to bridge this gap.
*   Describe a typical workflow for pre-training a model in simulation and fine-tuning it on real-world data.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 17.1: The Reality Gap**
*   **Lesson 17.2: Bridging the Gap**
