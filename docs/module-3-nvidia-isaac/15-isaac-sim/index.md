# Chapter 15: Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data

This chapter dives into the primary use case for Isaac Sim: generating high-quality, labeled data for training AI perception models. You will learn how Isaac Sim's Replicator tool can be used to create massive datasets with perfect ground truth, and how Domain Randomization can be applied to ensure the resulting models work in the real world.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Use the Isaac Sim interface to build a simple scene.
*   Use the Replicator framework to generate synthetic data with bounding boxes and segmentation masks.
*   Apply Domain Randomization to the textures and lighting in a scene.

## Lessons
*   **Lesson 15.1: Synthetic Data Generation**
*   **Lesson 15.2: Domain Randomization**
